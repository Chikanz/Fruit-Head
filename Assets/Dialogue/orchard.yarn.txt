//choices ranging from naive to accusatory??
MAISON: They're a cultist. Kell's a cultist.
AVERY: Maybe Kell escaped by disguising themself as a cultist. That's what happened, right? Kell?
KELL: I remember you. Avery, isn't it?
CHARLIE: Kell, please. Tell me you're not part of this.
KELL: I can't do that, Charlie.
EDEN: Kell, you're under arrest. 
EDEN: Show us where the missing people are, and I'll make sure you get a light sentence.
CHARLIE: How could you! A cult, Kell? Kidnapping?
KELL: You don't understand. We need those people.
MAISON: I told you the cult was eating people!
<<move Luca entry>>
KELL: We don't--
LUCA: Enough!
LUCA: Kell, go and ready the sacrifices. I'll deal with our guests.
KELL: ...
KELL: Yes, Luca. 
CHARLIE: Kell, wait--
KELL: I'm sorry, Charlie. You shouldn't have come here.
<<move Kell Exit>>
EDEN: Stand down, Luca.
LUCA: I'm afraid I can't do that, Officer.
CHARLIE: What did you do to Kell?
LUCA: Kell came to me of their own free will, Charlie.

//someone smart to lead the group
EDEN: If you help me get all these people back to Berry Island, I'll help you find Kell.

CHARLIE: Thanks, everyone.
EDEN: All right, let's get these people out of here.
CHARLIE: And then we'll find Kell.
