AVERY: Don't worry about it, Charlie. We should go and see Kell.
CHARLIE: Oooookay.
CHARLIE: You don't have to come with me. Didn't you have someone you wanted to see?
AVERY: Nah, no rush. I'll come with you.

MAISON: You saw the cultists try to get me, right? The cult is real. They're taking people.
MAISON: Think about it! Who has enough power in this town to make it all just go away?
