AVERY: Berry Island! We made it! 
AVERY: I'd forgotten how much I hate ships.
CHARLIE: I thought you said you'd never left Blossom Island before.
AVERY: ...I haven't.
CHARLIE: But you just said you hate ships. If you've never left the island, when--
AVERY: Don't worry about it, Charlie. We should go and see Kell.
CHARLIE: Oooookay.
CHARLIE: You don't have to come with me. Didn't you have someone you wanted to see?
AVERY: Nah, no rush. I'll come with you.
->All right, let's go.
//:) for not questioning
    AVERY: Thanks, Charlie.
->Are you sure? 
    AVERY: Yeah, it's nothing important. I can hang with you a bit longer.
    CHARLIE: Okay then.
->Uhhh...Fine.
    AVERY: Wow, don't get too excited about it. 
//:(
AVERY: Have you visited Kell here before? Do you know where they live?
CHARLIE: Yeah, their house is just up ahead.
AVERY: Then let's go say hi.

    AVERY: Cool. 
    AVERY: I wonder what Kell's been up to since they left Blossom Island.
    CHARLIE: Working, they said. I think they had a job in the mayor's office.
    AVERY: A politician, huh? Wonder if they've got any interesting dirt on the mayor lying around.
    AVERY: Want to look around?

TAM: You're all smiles and empty words. You wouldn't last a day in office.
LUCA: What's so bad about a smile?
TAM: You're weak. You haven't got the guts to do what needs to be done.
LUCA: You make it all sound so dramatic. 
LUCA: Friends, thank you for coming today. I know that what you've heard has shown you that I am the best candidate.
LUCA: Perhaps I am weak, as Tam says. 
LUCA: But surely it's better to be weak than hard-headed and full of aggression, howling like a mad wolf hungry for violence.
TAM: What is THAT supposed to mean?
LUCA: Have a good day, everyone.

CHARLIE: Hey, do you know what's going on?
EDEN: The last mayor of Berry Island recently passed away. 
EDEN: Those two up there are hoping to be the next one.
CHARLIE: It looked like it was getting pretty heated.
EDEN: Yeah. That's politics for you.
EDEN: Are you two visiting? I haven't seen you around before.
CHARLIE: I'm here to see my sibling, Kell. 
CHARLIE: Do you know them? They weren't at home.
EDEN: Yes, I know Kell. They worked for the last mayor.
EDEN: I haven't seen them in a few days...but they mostly keep to themself.
EDEN: Was Kell expecting you?
CHARLIE: I'm here to surprise them for their birthday.
//if you looked around the house
//AVERY: It looked like no one had been home for a few days.
EDEN: Hmm...I wonder...
EDEN: Several people have gone missing in the last few weeks.
CHARLIE: Kell's gone missing?!
EDEN: Well, we don't know that for sure. Why don't you ask around? Maybe someone's seen them.
EDEN: Come and find me at the police station if you find out anything.

CHARLIE: I think they've gone missing.

AVERY: ...
CHARLIE: You think that one of the people going for mayor is kidnapping people?
AVERY: To EAT them.
CHARLIE: As part of some weird cult ritual?
MAISON: You saw the cultists try to get me, right? The cult is real. They're taking people.
MAISON: Think about it! Who has enough power in this town to make it all just go away?
MAISON: The mayor, that's who! That's why Tam is trying so hard to win votes.
MAISON: They want to turn this town into an all-you-can-eat buffet!
AVERY: Riiiiight...
AVERY: [muttering] Charlie, they're crazy. //let's get out of here
CHARLIE: I don't know...maybe they're on to something. We both saw those cultists.
AVERY: They think Tam is eating people!
CHARLIE: I didn't say I believed everything they said.
CHARLIE: Maison, have you told the police about this?
MAISON: Ha, those idiots? They're useless! 
MAISON: They wouldn't be able to solve a mystery like this if the culprit was dancing naked in front of them wearing a sombrero!
CHARLIE: Well, I was talking to one of them earlier and they said they would help me find Kell.
CHARLIE: Will you come with me and tell them what you told us?
AVERY: [whispering] This is a terrible idea.
MAISON: Go to the police? They won't believe me. They're too stupid to see the truth.
->Please? We need your help.

CHARLIE: No, but we found Maison. They think they know why people are going missing.
MAISON: Hello there, Officer Eden.
EDEN: [sigh] Hello, Maison. What is it this time? I told you, no one's been drugging the water.
MAISON: All those people who've gone missing? I figured it out. Before you.
MAISON: It's a cult taking them. A cult led by Tam.
EDEN: ...
EDEN: A cult.
MAISON: See, Charlie? I told you they wouldn't believe me.
CHARLIE: Maison's right - about the cult, anyway. We saw them.
EDEN: Listen, kid. I don't know you, but I know Maison. Their theories are always getting them into trouble.
EDEN: Don't let them drag you into this.
AVERY: I hate to agree with the conspiracy nut, but...we really did see the cult.
EDEN: [sigh] Even if I believed you...Cults aren't illegal. I can't arrest people for belonging to a cult.
EDEN: If there IS a cult, and if they ARE taking people, I need proof. Solid proof. Can you give me that?

AVERY: Maybe there's some evidence at Kell's house we missed.
MAISON: We should talk to Tam. Get them to confess.
AVERY: You don't have to come with us anymore.
MAISON: If you're hunting the cult, there's no way I'm staying behind.
MAISON: Besides, they'll be after all of us now that we're on their trail.
MAISON: We need to stick together. There's safety in numbers.
AVERY: If you say so.
AVERY: It'll be a waste of time talking to Tam, though. If they are involved, they're not going to just tell us.
MAISON: It's a better idea than going to search some empty house.
AVERY: Guess it's up to you, Charlie.

CHARLIE: Avery? You know Tam?

    TAM: I know people are going missing. That's it.
