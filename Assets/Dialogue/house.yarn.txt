CHARLIE: Oh yeah, this is the present I bought for Kell. For their birthday. Which is today.
CHARLIE: And I said I would visit them on Berry Island.
CHARLIE: I should probably go and find a ship. 
->Take present
    <<Take Present>>
->Stay home and sleep in

HINTY: Good morning, Charlie. I just dropped by this morning to let you know a couple of things. First, you should press A to continue.
CHARLIE: Who are you and what are you doing in my house?
HINTY: I'm just here to help! Now, if you have a choice to make, you can use the left joystick to browse through your options. Got it?
->What?
    HINTY: Choices are part of life, Charlie. It's important that you can make the right one. Left joystick, remember that.
        ->I still don't understand.
            HINTY: Well, you'll figure it out eventually.
        ->Okay then.
            HINTY: Great!
->I think so...
    HINTY: That's great!
HINTY: One more thing. Remember how I said you can press A to continue? 
HINTY: You can also use A to interact with objects, like that baseball bat over there!
CHARLIE: Sure...
HINTY: Also, you can move about using the left joystick. And move the camera with the right joystick. 
CHARLIE: What camera?
HINTY: That's all for now! I'll see you later, Charlie!

CHARLIE: There's got to be some money in here somewhere.
CHARLIE: Maybe I should look between the couch cushions. And under the bed. And in every other piece of furniture.
<<show Hinty true>>
    HINTY: Hey there Charlie, it's me again! Just thought I'd give you another tip.
    HINTY: If you want to search the furniture, try the right trigger! 
    CHARLIE: O...kay?
    HINTY: Good luck, Charlie!
<<Take Hinty>>
