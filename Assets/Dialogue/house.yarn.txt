CHARLIE: Oh yeah, this is the present I bought for Kell. For their birthday. Which is today.
CHARLIE: And I said I would visit them on Berry Island.
CHARLIE: I should probably go and find a ship.

->Stay home and sleep in

HINTY: Good morning, Charlie. I just dropped by this morning to let you know a couple of things. First, you should press spacebar to continue.
CHARLIE: Who are you and what are you doing in my house?
HINTY: I'm just here to help! Now, if you have a choice to make, you can use the W and S keys to browse through your options. Got it?
->What are you talking about?
    HINTY: Choices are part of life, Charlie. It's important that you can make the right one. W and S keys, remember that.
        ->I still don't understand.
            HINTY: Well, you'll figure it out eventually.
        ->Okay then.
            HINTY: Great!
->I think so...
    HINTY: That's great!
HINTY: One more thing. Remember how I said you can press spacebar to continue? 
HINTY: You can also use the spacebar to interact with objects, like that baseball bat over there!
CHARLIE: Sure...
HINTY: That's all for now! I'll see you later, Charlie!

HINTY: Hey there Charlie, it's me again! Just thought I'd give you another tip.
HINTY: If you want to hit things, just left click! Maybe you should try hitting some furniture, and see what you find.
CHARLIE: O...kay?
HINTY: Good luck, Charlie!
